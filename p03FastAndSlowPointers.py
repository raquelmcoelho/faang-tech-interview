Solution: Happy Number

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return TRUE if n is a happy number, and FALSE if not.

Time complexity
The time complexity for the solution shown above is O(logn). If no cycle exists, the fast pointer will reach 1 and the slow pointer will reach halfway to 1. However, since there were two pointers instead of one, we know that in the worst-case scenario, the cost was O(2Ã—logn).

Space complexity
The memory complexity for the solution shown above is O(1)as we don't need any extra space because we are only manipulating pointers.
