Solution: Valid Palindrome

Write a function that takes a string s as input and checks whether itâ€™s a palindrome or not.

Note: A phrase, word or sequence is a palindrome that reads the same backwards as forwards.
 
Time complexity
The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of characters present in the string.

Space complexity
The space complexity is O(1) because we use constant space to store two indices.

        if s[left] != s[right]:  # If the elements at index l and index r are not equal,
            return False    # then the symmetry is broken, the string is not a palindrome
        left = left + 1  # Heading towards the right
        right = right - 1  # Heading towards the left
    # We reached the middle of the string without finding a mismatch, so it is a palindrome.
