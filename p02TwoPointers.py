Solution: Valid Palindrome

Write a function that takes a string s as input and checks whether itâ€™s a palindrome or not.

Note: A phrase, word or sequence is a palindrome that reads the same backwards as forwards.
 
Time complexity
The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of characters present in the string.

Space complexity
The space complexity is O(1) because we use constant space to store two indices.
