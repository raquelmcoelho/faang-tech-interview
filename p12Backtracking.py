Solution: N-Queens

Given a chessboard of sizen√ón, determine how many ways n queens can be placed on the board, such that no two queens attack each other.

A queen can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally on a chessboard. One queen can be attacked by another queen if both share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Time complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^n), where n is the dimension of the chessboard.

Space complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the dimension of the chessboard.
