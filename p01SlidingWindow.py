Solution: Find Maximum in Sliding Window

Given an integer array nums and a window of size w, find the current maximum value in the window as it slides through the entire array.

Note: If the window size is greater than the array size, we consider the entire array as a single window.

Time complexity
Hence, the overall time complexity of the solution, irrespective of the input, is 
O(w+n)

Space complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(w), where w is the size of the input list.
